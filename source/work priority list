Create Job Daemon
	Use Python Wrapper to allow FTP to run in the background.
	We need to monitor the CPU load during the jobdaemon.
		We can process 3-5 cards at the same time given load
		GPU runs 10-28% during processing. 
		Unknown is FTP time; however, this can be mitigated with more upload bandwidth
